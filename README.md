# calendar-function
Little calendar for your workday.

Added several functions to the base code, including identifying current hour. Added function to parse out hours from each hour div; still needs work.

Could not get it to apply CSS to differentiate times of day. Need to work still.

Working on code to save inputs to the console.

Got all the save buttons to work with message.
